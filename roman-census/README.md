# Roman Census
- Extract information about the Roman households and persons available from PDFs [catalogue-of-census-declarations.pdf](input_pdf/catalogue-of-census-declarations.pdf) and [catalogue-of-census-declarations-supplement.pdf](input_pdf/catalogue-of-census-declarations-supplement.pdf)
- Stores information for households and persons in separate CSVs

# Solution
- Extract text from PDF using PyMuPDF
- Each page text is parsed to identify the required data for household CSV
  - household_number_year,
  - household_number_location,
  - household_number_order,
  - source,provenance,
  - provenance_place,
  - provenance_year,
  - declarant_name_1,
  - declarant_name_2,
  - declarant_name_3,
  - declarant_name_4,
  - declarant_name_5,
  - declarant_ids,
  - declarant_occupation,
  - number_of_family_members,
  - number_of_non_family_members,
  - number_of_slaves,
  - verif_photo,
  - discussion_text,
  - discussion_indicates_substantive_record_brokenness
- Houshold data is also written in a different format in [input persons csv](input_csv\persons_input.csv)
- [persons.py](persons.py) process the [input persons csv](input_csv\persons_input.csv) to determine the data for persons
- It process family members, non-kin members and slaves. 
- Relation between persons are also identified and related Ids are updated
- Persons data is stored in CSV with below columns
  - household_id,
  - id,
  - name,

  - age,
  - occupation,
  - father,
  - mother,
