R. Smolders, ZPE 148 (2004) 239-40, identifies the declarant's former wife as Didymarion d. Apion, known from the archive of the descendants of Aphrodisios; he suggests that she was deceased rather than divorced at the time of this declaration, but the date of her death is not certain to have fallen before 133.
