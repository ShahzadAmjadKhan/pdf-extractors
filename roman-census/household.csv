Re-editions and Reprints of Texts Used in the First Edition Apart from these full reprints or reditions of texts, volumes 9-11 of the BL have appeared since 1993. These should be consulted for smaller corrections to published texts used in the first edition.

R. Smolders, ZPE 148 (2004) 239-40, identifies the declarant's former wife as Didymarion d. Apion, known from the archive of the descendants of Aphrodisios; he suggests that she was deceased rather than divorced at the time of this declaration, but the date of her death is not certain to have fallen before 133.

Barker, Akten XXI, 61-63, offers a different restoration of lines 3-4, with shorter restorations and eliminating the co- resident ex-wife of the declarant. We do not accept his restoration. 159-Ar-6  SB XXII15337 (where wrongly listed as 159-Ar-5) J. Straus, L'achat et la vente des esclaves dans VEgypte romainQ (Miinchen-Leipzig 2004) 13 proposes that instead of the slave Niicnv the text should read [Kir|T]iKf|v, referring to Helike, thus reducing by one the number of slaves declared. 159-Ar-8  SB XX 14326 159-Ar-19  SB XVIII13292,13293,13294 159-Ar-21  SB  X X 14164 159-Ar-22  SB  X X 14164 159-Ar-25  SB  XVIII13290, 13291 159-Ar-26  SB  X X 14111 159-Hm-3  SB XX 14666, 14667 (the two Michigan copies), 14668 (the Oslo copy) 159-Ox-2  Formerly ???-Ox-2 173-Ar-2  D. C. Barker, Akten XXI, 64-65, attempts a restoration of what the scribe should have written, suggesting that the divorced wife, sister on his mother's side, Stotoetis, is still a member of the household. This is possible, but the evidence is inconclusive.
